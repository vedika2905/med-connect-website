# med-connect-website
Med Connect is a medical resource website that visually connects patients to doctors. Users can interact with an image of the human body to select specific organs or body parts. Each section links to a list of diseases related to that area. Upon selecting a disease, the site displays OPD schedules and doctor availability for that condition.
